# Final Project: A Doom Clone

This is the final project for Game Programming at Concord Academy. My final project is a clone of Doom/Wolfenstein 3D using raycasting for psuedo-3D. 

Here's a screenshot of my progress so far:

The DOOM sprites should be creditted to Falcon Delta,
and the raycasting uses a Go binding of SFML found
here: https://github.com/zyedidia/sfml

The raycasting is based on muthdra's raycasting using
SDL2, which can be found here: https://gist.github.com/muthdra/e4bc2507cad8ce6fb3f85f07a4fdc7c5
