# Final Project: A Doom Clone

This is the final project for Game Programming at Concord Academy. My final project is a clone of Doom/Wolfenstein 3D using raycasting for psuedo-3D. 

Here's a screenshot of my progress so far:

The DOOM weapon sprites should be creditted to Falcon Delta,
and the raycasting uses a Go binding of SFML found
here: https://github.com/zyedidia/sfml

The raycasting is based on Lode Vandevenne's tutorial on raycasting using
QuickCG in C++, which can be found here: http://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html
